# The Plant Based Experiment Landing Page
The Landing page is fully responsive & mobile friendly.

It features playfair display &lato as it's fonts. These two work well with the theme.

The color scheme is green & white with background overlays to highlight the images & text.

It has scripts that include a mobile menu slider, a reveal slider & an email mailer.

Troubleshooting

I'm using this page to test out css scroll-behavior. So far not so good, it defintely has performance issues & it's consistency sucks.

Update

Fixed the mobile version. Made a scrollbar on the nav menu so it scrolls. Fixed the email section image so it covers the whole section. Fixed the hero section header so it's in the middle of the section. Fixed the Nodemailer message so the right message displays depending on wether the email goes through.

Update

This is the new version without firebase from codesandbox
